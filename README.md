I will save actions that I use frequently in my repositories.

This action saves an SSH key in the `/tmp/id_rsa` path of the current runner and tests the connection before it.

#### How to Use Save SSH Key Action

It is necessary to declare these secrets below:

- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `SSH_HOST`
- `SSH_PORT`
- `SSH_USERNAME`

##### Parameters

- ssh-key-path â€“ Destination of SSH Key. As default `/tmp/id_rsa`

### Clean Up

There is an optional parameter to specify the locale of the SSH Key. It is the same value of ssh-key-path from [save ssh key](#save-ssh-key).
